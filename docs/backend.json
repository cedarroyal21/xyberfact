    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to support the FactLens application's fact-checking browser extension. It focuses on enabling users to report fake or misleading websites, while adhering to the core design principles of Authorization Independence, Clarity of Intent, DBAC (Database-Based Access Control), and QAPs (Rules Are Not Filters).\n\n**Authorization Independence:** The `/users/{userId}/websiteReports/{reportId}` structure guarantees authorization independence.  A user can only create, read, update, or delete reports under their own user ID.  No `get()` calls are needed in security rules to verify ownership.  The `reporterId` field inside the `websiteReports` collection duplicates the information already available in the path, but formally fulfills the need to avoid database reads for authorization.\n\n**Clarity of Intent:** The path `/users/{userId}/websiteReports/{reportId}` clearly expresses ownership: Website reports are owned by the user identified by `userId`. This structure avoids mixing different access control schemes within a single collection, contributing to debuggability.\n\n**DBAC (No Custom Claims):** User roles or permissions are not stored in custom claims. Authorization is based on the `request.auth.uid` matching the `userId` in the path. This simplifies security rules and makes them easier to understand and maintain.\n\n**QAPs (Rules are not Filters):** The structure allows secure `list` operations. A user can list only their own website reports by querying `/users/{userId}/websiteReports`.  The security rules can enforce that only the authenticated user (`request.auth.uid`) can access their own reports, preventing unauthorized listing of other users' data.\n\n**Data Integrity and Predictability:**  The schema for `WebsiteReport` enforces required fields, preventing incomplete or invalid data.  The `status` field is used for explicit state management, avoiding the need to infer state from multiple fields.  Consistent naming conventions (e.g., `reporterId`) enhance predictability.\n\nIn Summary, the chosen structure prioritizes secure, scalable, and easily debuggable security rules by ensuring authorization independence, clarity of intent, and adherence to best practices for Firestore data modeling."
